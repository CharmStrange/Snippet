Decompile with [jd-gui](https://java-decompiler.github.io/)

(I did not use any of these sources code for utilizing something. I just wanna see how code works. That's all.)

---

1. Open [jd-gui](Games/Forgotten Tales/Decompiles/jd-gui-1.6.6.jar)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc29fce6-8619-410b-8897-7a2e0b5b090b)

2. Find *.jar* file and open with it.

3. Check how file structure.
